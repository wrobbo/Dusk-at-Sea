# Dusk-at-Sea
A dusk ocean scene created with the HTML5 Canvas. 

The user can interact with the wave by moving the mouse along the x axis; the further along the axis the mouse is, the more amplitude the wave will have.

The user can also click anywhere on the canvas in order to enable or disable the 'seaside.mp3' sound.
